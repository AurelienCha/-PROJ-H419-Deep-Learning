# [PROJ-H419] Batch size and learning rate in Deep Learning

A Keras model to infer bounding box coordinates of synthetic black images with white boxes
to evaluate the influence of batch size and learning rate in a simple box regression problem.

**Report :** In-depth analysis and interpretation of the results (5 pages)

**Youtube video :** Overview of the project and the code with a resume of the results (duration 10 min)

## The code

The folder code contains 3 jupyter notebooks used for this project. 

This separation is made in order to make it easy to navigate through the code.

- The first one generates the dataset.
- The second one creates and trains different models.
- The third one analyse the data generated by the training.
